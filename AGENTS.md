# Neon Ronin Agent Handoff

## Active Scope

This repository is now governed by `ART_LOCK_GOAL.md`.

The current objective is a reference-driven Art Lock build, not the prior Stage 1 vertical slice. Do not claim Stage 1 is complete while this goal is active.

## Required Reference Package

Use this package as the visual authority:

```text
art/references/neon_ronin_art_refs_impl_ready/
```

It contains A-H Markdown/PNG references. The PNGs are specification sheets only. Never paste the reference sheets into runtime.

## Current Gate State

- Gate A: approved by explicit human phrase `Approve Gate A` on 2026-06-26.
- Gate B v1: rejected as visually below product level.
- Gate B v2: approved by explicit human input `ゲートBを承認します` on 2026-06-27.
- Latest visual revision: enemy/friendly accent groups are separated. Player/friendly keeps cyan/magenta; enemy eyes, cores, and telegraphs use amber/vermilion. `art:validate-assets` now checks enemy runtime assets for zero player-hue residue.

Gate A evidence currently includes:

- `art/TOOL_CAPABILITY_REPORT.md`
- `art/REFERENCE_ANALYSIS.md`
- `art/REFERENCE_COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md`
- `art/ART_BIBLE.md`
- `art/reviews/candidates/`
- `art/reviews/gate-a/representative-composite-960x540.png`
- `art/approvals/GATE_A_REQUEST.md`
- `art/approvals/GATE_A_STATUS.json`
- `art/reviews/gate-a/gate-a-viewer-960x540.png`
- `art/reviews/gate-a/gate-a-package-report.md`

## Commands

Use `npm.cmd` on Windows PowerShell.

Current Art Lock commands:

```bash
npm.cmd run art:refs
npm.cmd run art:process
npm.cmd run art:atlas
npm.cmd run art:contact-sheets
npm.cmd run art:gate-status
npm.cmd run art:validate-assets
npm.cmd run art:validate-sign-density
npm.cmd run art:validate-animations
npm.cmd run art:validate-vfx
npm.cmd run art:validate-telegraphs
npm.cmd run art:screenshots
npm.cmd run art:review-report
npm.cmd run art:all
```

Final Art Lock commands from `ART_LOCK_GOAL.md` must inspect real final assets, screenshots, revision rounds, scorecards, and approvals.

## Handoff Rules

- Treat `AGENTS.md` as a live operations log.
- Keep Gate A/Gate B approval state explicit.
- Do not weaken validators to make progress appear complete.
- Do not use plain Phaser primitive programmer art as final visual implementation.
- Do not keep misleading Stage 1/campaign claims in docs.
- If a required visual-production/browser capability is unavailable, report the concrete blocker.

## Next Step

Gate B v2 is approved. The next implementation scope should use this approved visual system rather than changing the art direction.

Legacy Stage 1 runtime, tests, scripts, and `artifacts/qa` evidence have already been removed from the runnable source tree. The current runtime is `BootScene -> PreloadScene -> TitleScene`, with deterministic `ArtLabScene` review states available via `?scene=artlab&state=...`.
